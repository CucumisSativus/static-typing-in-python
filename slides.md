## What is mypy

> Mypy is a static type checker for Python 3 and Python 2.7. 

* It checks the correctness of the type annotations (PEP 484 and PEP 526)

--

* You can install it with pip 

--

* It can be run on one file, multiple files or recursively over a directory
```
mypy program.py
```
--

* **After type check annotations are no longer used - program is executed as standard python program**

???

I will tell more about type annotations later on

## Type annotations
```python
a_variable: int = 3
def function(a: int) -> str:
    return f"{a}"

function("asdf")
```

```
error: Argument 1 to "function" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
```

---

## Type inference


```python
def function(a: int) -> str:
    return f"{a}"

def function2(b: int) -> str:
    return f"{b}"

result1 = function(5)
function2(result1)
```

```
error: Argument 1 to "function2" has incompatible type 
"str"; expected "int"
```

???

Even though result1 is not explicitly typed, mypy gets the type right

---

## Type inference in classes

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, attr: int) -> None:
        self.attr = attr


MyClass(10).attr + 'b'
```

```
error: Unsupported operand types for + ("int" and "str")
```

---

## Type inference in class with dynamic context

``` python
class Vicious:
    def just_method(self) -> None:
        self.member = 1

v = Vicious()
v.just_method()
v.member + 's'
```
---

## Type inference in class with dynamic context

```python
class Vicious:
    def just_method(self) -> None:
        self.member = 1
    
    def another_method(self) -> None:
        self.member = 's'
```
```
Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "str", variable has type "int")
```

---
## Possible type annotations

* numbers (`int`, `float`, `Decimal` ...)
* strings
* collections (`List[int]`, `Dict[str, int]`, `Set[int]` ...) - notice upper case name
* our own classes (`BusinessReport`, `CheckoutController`...)
* `None`
* `Optional`
* lambdas (`Callable[[int], str]`)
* special types `Any` and `NoReturn`
* generics

---
## Any

```python
from typing import Any

def function_with_any(argument: Any):
    argument.not_existing_method()

    for a in argument:
        print(a)
    
    argument + 1
```
```
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

---

## Any

* It can be considered a type that has all values and all methods [link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#the-any-type)
* It passes the static check, but fails in runtime
* `Any` turns off type checking

---

## NoReturn


```python
def method_that_returns() -> NoReturn:
    return 1
```

error: Return statement in function which does not return

---

## NoReturn

* Shows that given function do not return anything
* Cannot create an instance of `NoReturn`
* Can be very useful, I will show it later

---


## Union types

```python
from typing import Union

class Admin: pass

class Employee: pass

User = Union[Admin, Employee]

def handle_login(user: User):
    if isinstance(user, Admin):
        print("Admin login")
    else:
        print("User login")

handle_login(Admin())
handle_login(Employee())
```

???

Union types are sum types (`Admin` or `Employee`)
---

## Union types

* good for modeling data with different shapes (user is either Admin or Employee)
* types do not have to have a common root
* types from external libraries can be used here as well


---
## Optional
### Problem

```python
def function() -> str:
    return None

function() + "suffix"
```
In runtime

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'str'
```
--

With mypy
```
error: Incompatible return value type (got "None", expected "str")
```

---
## Optional

* `Optional[T]` is `Union[T, None]`
* Type safe way to indicate that given type can be nullable

---

## Type guards

```python
from typing import Optional

def add_unsafe(number: Optional[int]) -> int:
    return number + 1
# error: Unsupported operand types for + ("None" and "int")
# note: Left operand is of type "Optional[int]"


def add(number: Optional[int]) -> int:
    if number:
        # mypy knows that number is not None here
        return number + 1
    else:
        return 1
```
---

## Exhaustiveness checking
### Problem

```python
from typing import Union

class Employee: pass
class Manager: pass
class Administrator: pass

User = Union[Employee, Manager, Administrator]

def function(user: User) -> str:
    if isinstance(user, Employee):
        return "Employee"
    else:
        return "Manager"
```
```
Success: no issues found in 1 source file

```
---

## Exhaustiveness checking
### Solution [link](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/735)

```python
def assert_never(x: NoReturn) -> NoReturn:
    raise AssertionError(f"Invalid value: {x!r}")

def function(user: User):
    if isinstance(user, Employee):
        return "Employee"
    elif isinstance(user, Manager):
        return "Manager"
    else:
        assert_never(user)

# error: Argument 1 to "assert_never" 
# has incompatible type "Administrator"; expected "NoReturn"
```
---
## Structural polymorphism - problem

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Admin:
    email: str
    admin_id: str

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Employee:
    email: str
    employee_id: str

def send_email(with_email: Any):
    print(with_email.email)

send_email(Admin("email", "admin_id"))
send_email(Employee("email", "employee_id"))
send_email(42)
```

???

You can pass both Admin and Employee, no typecheck
---

## Structural polymorphism

```python
from typing import Protocol
from dataclasses import dataclass

class WithEmail(Protocol):
    @property
    def email(self) -> str:
        pass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Admin:
    email: str
    admin_id: str

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Employee:
    email: str
    employee_id: str

def send_email(with_email: WithEmail):
    print(with_email.email)

send_email(Admin("email", "admin_id"))
send_email(Employee("email", "employee_id"))
```
---
## Structural polymorphism

* You can define polymorphic relation basing on the structure
* You don't need to modify the type - you can use classes from libraries
* Great for modeling data and extracting common data pieces from unrelated types
* More explicit than union types
* Big disadvantage is that you cannot track implementations - as opposed to inheritance

---

## New Types

### Problem
```python
order_id = 123
company_id = 3

def find_company_order(company_id: int, order_id: int) -> str:
    return f"company_id={company_id} order_id={order_id}"

print(find_company_order(order_id, company_id))
# => company_id=123 order_id=3

```
---

## Solution
```python
from typing import NewType

OrderId = NewType('OrderId', int)
CompanyId = NewType('CompanyId', int)

order_id = OrderId(123)
company_id = CompanyId(3)
def find_company_order(company_id: CompanyId, order_id: OrderId) -> str:
    return f"company_id={company_id} order_id={order_id}"

find_company_order(order_id, company_id)

# error: Argument 1 to "find_company_order" has incompatible type 
# "OrderId"; expected "CompanyId"
# error: Argument 2 to "find_company_order" has incompatible type 
# "CompanyId"; expected "OrderId"
```
---

## New types

* Add another level of type safety 
* Great for documentation

---

## When mypy falls short
### Untyped argument

```python
def function_untyped(argument):
    argument.not_existing_method()

    for a in argument:
        print(a)
    
    argument + 1
```
```
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

???

Because of gradual typing filosophy, it fails siletly
---

## Generics

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

class MyList(Generic[T]):
    def append(self, value: T) -> None:
        pass

    def pop(self) -> T:
        pass

intlist = MyList[int]()
intlist.append(5)
value: int = intlist.pop()

intlist.append("str")
# argument 1 to "append" of "MyList" 
# has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"

```
---
### Generics
* used when we want to have a class, that does not care about what is inside
* gives guarantees that `T` is always the same - `MyList[int]` always work with `int`
* generic parameter says `fill this hole to have a complete type`
* you cannot use just `MyList`, its not a complete type

## When mypy falls short
### Untyped return

```python
def function_untyped(argument):
    return argument

a = function_untyped(4)
a.not_existing_method("str") + 1

```

```
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

???

Because of gradual typing filosophy, it fails siletly
---

## When mypy falls short
### Untyped import

```python
import requests
requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
```

```
error: Library stubs not installed for "requests" (or incompatible with Python 3.10)
note: Hint: "python3 -m pip install types-requests"
note: (or run "mypy --install-types" to install all missing stub packages)
note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```

???

You can download types if they exist or ignore the issue
---

## Untyped import ignore

```python
import requests # type: ignore
requests.not_existing # obviously fails
```
```
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

Note: you can globally ignore certain library in mypy config
---

## With types installed

```python
import requests
requests.not_existing # obviously fails
```

```
imports.py:2: error: Module has no attribute "not_existing"
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
``` 

---

## When mypy falls short

In all those situations mypy is doing a fallback to *Any* = no type check

* untyped arguments
* untyped return
* import from untyped library (if import error is ignored)
---
class: center, middle

## Solution
### mypy --strict
---

## Conclusion

* Type checking can spot certain classes of errors
* mypy's type system is flexible and quite sophisticated (union types, type guards and structural polymorphism)
* You can type your application gradually
* But you have to remember that mypy is not doing anything for untyped code fragments
